# IAS - Class Lab: Build FTP based Web Browser

# Instructions

- I've taken a FTP based file storage on driveHQ with the following credentials:-
  hostname="ftp.DriveHQ.com"
  username="prashant_123"
  passowrd="asit@#1234"
- I've created a FTP client which supports the following functionalities:-

1. LIST the files (press 1)
2. UPLOAD the file (press 2 and write filname)
3. DOWNLOAD the file (press 3 and write filename)
4. DELETE the file (press 4 and write filename)
5. quit (press 5)

- To run the client, simply run
  `python3 client.py`
  and then provide any of the above inputs as required.

- If a file with this particular filename is present in the cloud then it will download that file and print its content on the screen.

# Note (Works well with .txt and .html file)
